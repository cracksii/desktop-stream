Have you ever wanted to check the current state of your monitor, while watching tv or using your smartphone?

If you do, I got perfect solution for you!

# desktop-stream

Is a python application, using flask and pyautogui, that can stream your desktop to any device in your local network.

It is password protected (I know the protection is far from secure, but in a local network this is in my opinion not necessary) and 

works on every sort of device with an internet browser and a display. 

To choose your own password, just change the `PASSWORD` constant in the script to whatever password you like.

Have fun modifying and improving the code on your nedd.
